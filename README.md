# subisosat_lib

This library provides methods to solve the subgraph isomorphism problem by using a SAT solver (minisat). The methods the library provides are the same methods the igraph library offers with the same interface. Specifically

 - igraph_subisomorphic_sat
 - igraph_get_subisomorphisms_sat
 - igraph_count_subisomorphisms_sat

The documentation for the equivelent igraph metods can be found at: http://igraph.org/c/doc/igraph-Isomorphism.html#igraph_subisomorphic.


To compile, unpack and type make. To install into $home/lib, type make install.
