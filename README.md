# subisosat_lib
This library provides methods to solve the subgraph isomorphism problems using a SAT solver (minisat). The methods that the library provide are the same methods that the igraph library offers (with the same interface). Specifically
 - igraph_subisomorphic_sat
 - igraph_get_subisomorphisms_sat
 - igraph_count_subisomorphisms_sat

The documentation for the equivelent igraph metods can be found at: http://igraph.org/c/doc/igraph-Isomorphism.html#igraph_subisomorphic.
